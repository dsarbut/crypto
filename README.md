CryptoBack
- Bakend ASP .net core project exposing the API's to the MAUI app. It can be ran directly using the built-in docker configuration. The Database already contains some date.

CryptoMAUI
- Maui app containing the front-end. It should be ran on an Android emulator, otherwise a physical Android device must be allowed to access the beckend url.
- It can be run also on Windows, but the MAUI CarouselView used in the portfolio page is very buggy on Windows.

Docs
- Contains a recording of the app runnning on an adroid emulator.
